# Weather Data Library and Analyzer using C
In this project, I created a C program that receives a large amount of weather data files, and efficiently stores and categorizes it for the user to make querys.

## Functionalities
The available actions for the data given are:
* Find the maximum and minimum temperature registered on a given date range, as well as all the data regarding the station it was registered in
* Find the average maximum and minimum temperatures registered on a given date among the different weather stations loaded to the database

## How to use it
To make use of this project, make sure to download all the files, including the folder with the Weather Data files.
1. In the FileNames.txt file, you have to include all the file names of the data you want to load
2. The folder _45592_2021-07-01-13-45-07_ has to include the files with the weather data
3. To compile the program, you just have to make use of the Makefile file included in the project, by executing the command __make__ without other arguments.

That's it! If you have any questions or comments regarding this project, feel free to reach out to me!
